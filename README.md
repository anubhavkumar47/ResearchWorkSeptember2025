The proposed framework enhances decision-making efficiency by combining
the learning-based adaptability of UAV swarm coordination with the reasoning
and contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs. Through this integra-
tion, we achieve dynamic optimization of task distribution, energy utilization,
and communication reliability in UAV-assisted IoT systems. The proposed
LLM-guided approach marks a significant advancement toward autonomous,
scalable, and resilient IoT infrastructures supported by cooperative UAV
networks.
